## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Background stretching under navbar

- **Challenge**: The hero background image was scrolling under the navbar.
- **Solution**: Consulted a senior developer. He showed me how to adjust the navbar width and positioning to fix the issue.

### 2. File naming convention

- **Challenge**: Constants and interfaces were originally `.tsx` which caused confusion.
- **Solution**: Renamed them to `.ts` files and updated imports accordingly.

### 3. Product images & Next.js Image component

- **Challenge**: Using `<img>` triggered warnings and missing `width`/`height` errors.
- **Solution**: Switched to `next/image` with explicit width and height.

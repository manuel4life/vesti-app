## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Background stretching under navbar

- **Challenge**: The hero background image was scrolling under the navbar.
- **Solution**: Consulted a senior developer. He showed me how to adjust the navbar width and positioning to fix the issue.

### 2. File naming convention

- **Challenge**: Constants and interfaces were originally `.tsx` which caused confusion.
- **Solution**: Renamed them to `.ts` files and updated imports accordingly.

### 3. Product images & Next.js Image component

- **Challenge**: Using `<img>` triggered warnings and missing `width`/`height` errors.
- **Solution**: Switched to `next/image` with explicit width and height.

- **Challenge**: Creating a Hero carousel
- **Solution**: Implemented a custom React state with useState and useEffect to auto-slide images. Added left/right arrows and dots for manual control. This improved the UI and made it more interactive.

- **Challenge**: ProductCard button alignment issues
- **Solution**: Used flexbox + fixed height container for each card to make all buttons line up regardless of product description length.

# üõçÔ∏è Product Details Page

We implemented a dynamic product details page at `/products/[id]` which:

- Fetches product data from [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com)
- Displays the **main product image** plus selectable thumbnails
- Shows **product title, category, description and price**
- Includes an **Add to Cart** button

## üìù Challenges i Faced

### 4. Next.js `<Image />` and Remote Images

Initially, i used plain `<img>` tags to display images from the API.  
Next.js recommended switching to `<Image />` from `next/image` for better performance.  
However, this introduced runtime errors such as:

- **Cart Page** where users can:

  - View items added to the cart
  - Increase or decrease item quantity
  - Remove items from the cart
  - See total price calculated dynamically

  ### Checkout Page

- Users can review their cart, adjust quantities, or remove items.
- Displays subtotal, shipping, and total.
- Simple checkout form (name, email, phone, address).
- ‚ÄúPlace Order‚Äù button clears the cart and shows confirmation (placeholder for backend integration).
- Page: `/checkout`.
